### Lesson 0 - The Terminal & Git

Writing code is only one of the many tasks computer programers must become proficient in to be able to do anything useful. There is a whole suite of technologies you must learn, depending on how you are planning to exercise your programming knowledge.

We start this course by understanding how we interact with our computer through a terminal, and how to download new technologies (software).

#### The Terminal

A "terminal" is an electronic device that is used for entering data into, and displaying or printing data from, a computing system.

Modern operating systems (MacOS X, Windows, Ubuntu...) use a terminal emulator (simulator) program, and not a hardware device.
