### Lab 0 - Lessons 0 to 3

This lab will keep things simple. We will do 5 small exercises, incremental in difficulty.

Review your mathematical operators, literal types, lists, conditions,
loops, and be sure to comment out your code where you deem necessary.

Exercises are self contained in the files:

* `a.py`
* `b.py`
* `c.py` (TBD)
* `d.py` (TBD)
* `e.py` (TBD)

The solutions are in the corresponding files:

* `a_soln.py`
* `b_soln.py`
* `c_soln.py` (TBD)
* `d_soln.py` (TBD)
* `e_soln.py` (TBD)
